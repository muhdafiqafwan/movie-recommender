# Movie Recommender System
A system developed as a part of my Capstone Project

The objective of this project is to create and implement a movie recommendation system. The system will use Pearson Correlation to compare the movies rated by users and recommend movies that are most similar to the movie that are chosen by the user. The website will be used primarily by the user and admin. Users are required to create an individual account to use the system. Besides, users should be able to view list of movies, view movie details, add movies to favorite, view list of favorite movies, and view recommended movies. In addition, the admin of the system is able to login to the system to add new users, add new movies, view list of users, and view list of movies.
